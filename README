## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The workflow is built with a single trigger and a single action:

1.  **Trigger:** The Zap starts whenever a **New Form Response** is submitted to the specified Google Form.
2.  **Action:** It then takes that data and performs a **Create Spreadsheet Row** action in Google Sheets, mapping each answer to its corresponding column.
